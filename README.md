## Usage Examples

### 1. Setting up models

```php
use Sowailem\Ownable\Traits\HasOwnables;
use Sowailem\Ownable\Traits\IsOwnable;
use Sowailem\Ownable\Contracts\Ownable as OwnableContract;

// Owner model (e.g., User)
class User extends Authenticatable implements OwnerContract
{
    use HasOwnables;
}

// Ownable model
class Post extends Model implements OwnableContract
{
    use IsOwnable;
}
```

### 2. Using the package

#### Giving Ownership

```php
$user = User::first();
$post = Post::first();

// Give ownership
$user->giveOwnershipTo($post);
// Or
$post->ownedBy($user);
// Or using facade
Owner::give($user, $post);
```

#### Checking Ownership

```php
// Check ownership
if ($user->owns($post)) {
    // User owns this post
}
// Or
if ($post->isOwnedBy($user)) {
    // Post is owned by this user
}
// Or using facade
if (Owner::check($user, $post)) {
    // Check ownership using facade
}
```

#### Transferring Ownership

```php
// Transfer ownership
$newOwner = User::find(2);
$user->transferOwnership($post, $newOwner);
// Or
$post->transferOwnershipTo($newOwner);
// Or using facade
Owner::transfer($user, $newOwner, $post);
```

#### Retrieving Owned Items and Owners

```php
// Get all owned items
$user->ownables()->get();

// Get current owner of an item
$currentOwner = $post->currentOwner();

// Get all owners (including historical)
$allOwners = $post->owners()->get();

// Get only current owners
$currentOwners = $post->owners()->wherePivot('is_current', true)->get();
```

#### Taking Ownership Away

```php
// Remove ownership
$user->takeOwnershipFrom($post);
```
